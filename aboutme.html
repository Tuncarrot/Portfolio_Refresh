                    <p>Hello! My name is Adam Tunkiewicz and my goal is to become a software developer. My interest in development grew from my love of making things, playing with robotics, and using computers.</p>
                    <p>My first introduction to coding was with LEGO Mindstorms, which was a robotics set for young kids that allowed you to drag and drop program multiple motors and sensors. This was the gateway drug that led to programming and playing with Raspberry PIs. This was also when I realized there was something special about programming and seeing visual results.</p>
                    <p>I took my first programming course in high school. This was a basic introduction to HTML, CSS, JS and the Turing language. During this time, we also learned about some creativity programs such as Blender and Photoshop.</p>
                    <p>Game Development is a very unique process for me as it allows me to combine so many different interests, such as coding, 3D modeling, level design, asset creation and music making.</p>
                    <p>I have also recently graduated from Conestoga College's Software Engineering program and have been accepted to Lauier's Computer Science program.</p>
                    <p>My most recent interests have been in front end development and using creative designs to create unique experiences.</p>
